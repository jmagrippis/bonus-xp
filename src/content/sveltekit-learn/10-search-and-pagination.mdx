## The need for Search and Pagination

Rendering data, then rendering them beautifully on the screen, may be the bread and butter of web development... but at some point, we’ll have **too much** data!

Users should be able to carry out their business, but they’d be less performant. Their browser may struggle rendering too many elements. They’ll struggle finding what they want amongst them!

So, for both the performance of our users, and the performance of our web app, in this chapter we’ll implement awesome Search & Pagination!
